I'm a Software Engineer with an interest in the language of computers. In this stage of my Computer Science journey, I'm taking a dive in the world of Data Analytics. I've grown fond of using applications to display big data in a user friendly environment. When I am not coding, I'm usually at a coffeeshop somewhere reading.

## Currently Learning

**Data Analytics** - Currently, I'm using Microsoft Azure, .NET, and Hadoop technologies: Event Hubs, Cloud Services, Web Apps, Blob Storage, SQL Azure, and HDInsight to convert data into powerful real-time visualizations.
